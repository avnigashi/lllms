## lllms

Local Large Language Models. Providing an LLM instance pool and tools to run and host multiple large language models on any machine. Built on [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/) via [node-llama-cpp](https://github.com/withcatai/node-llama-cpp) and [gpt4all](https://github.com/nomic-ai/gpt4all).

Note that this is a dev and learning tool and not meant for production use. It is not secure, not scalable, and (currently) not (enough) optimized for performance. It is meant to be used on a local machine or a small server for personal use or small scale experiments. Prioritizing ease of use and simple APIs. For larger scale hosting see [these other solutions](#related-solutions).

‚ö†Ô∏è This package is currently a WIP and many things are subject to change or not yet implemented.

### Features

- Run multiple large language models concurrently, until your CPU or RAM runs out.
- Automatically download and cache GGUF's to `~/.cache/lllms`.
- OpenAI spec API endpoints. See [#progress](#progress) for compatibility.
- Cache loaded models and their contexts/sessions across requests.
- BYO web server or use the provided express server and middleware.
- Use the LLM instance pool on its own within your application.

### Usage

#### JavaScript APIs

See [./src/server.ts](./src/server.ts) for ways to integrate with existing HTTP servers.

To integrate with web servers other than express use the `LLMServer` + `createOpenAIRequestHandlers`.

If you're not interested in a HTTP API and just want to use LLMs within your node application check out these [./examples](./examples) for usage of the lower-level LLMServer and the underlying LLMPool.

The highest level API, to spin up a standalone server:

```js lllms.js
import { serveLLMs } from 'lllms'

// Starts a http server for up to two instances of phi3 and exposes them via openai API
serveLLMs({
  listen: {
    port: 3000,
  },
  // Limit how many completions can be processed concurrently.
  // If its exceeded, requests will stall until a slot is free.
  concurrency: 2,
  // Custom model directory, defaults to `~/.cache/lllms`
  // modelsDir: '/path/to/models',
  models: {
    // Model names can use a-zA-Z0-9_:\-
    'phi3-mini-4k': {
      // Model weights may be specified only by url.
      url: 'https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct-gguf/resolve/main/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct-q4.gguf',
      // file: 'Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct-q4.gguf', // resolves to /path/to/models/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct-q4.gguf
      // file: '~/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct-q4.gguf', // resolves to /home/user/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct-q4.gguf
      // file: '/home/user/models/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct-q4.gguf',
      engine: 'node-llama-cpp',
      // Per default download will begin only once the first request comes in.
      maxInstances: 2,
      // minInstances: 1, // Uncomment to download on startup and immediately load an instance.
    },
  },
})
// During download completion requests will stall to get processed once the model is ready.
// You can navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view status.
```
```sh
$ curl http://localhost:3000/openai/v1/chat/completions \

  ],
  "usage": {
    "prompt_tokens": 6,
    "completion_tokens": 69,
    "total_tokens": 75
  }
}
```

#### HTTP API

On the packaged server there is only one additional HTTP endpoint that is not part of the OpenAI API at `/openai/v1`.

- `GET /` - Prints the pool status and download stats.

System role messages are supported only as the first message in a chat completion session. All other system messages will be ignored.

Note that the current context-reuse implementation only works if (apart from the final user message) the same messages are resent in the same order. This is because the messages will be hashed to be compared during follow up turns. If no hash matches, a fresh context will be used and passed messages will be reingested.

#### TODO / Roadmap

Not in any particular order:

- [x] Automatic download of GGUF's with ipull
- [x] Engine abstraction
- [x] Model instance pool and queue
- [x] Basic OpenAI API compatibility
- [x] POC of chat context reuse across requests
- [x] Tests for context reuse and context leaking
- [ ] Logging Interface
- [ ] Tests for longer conversations
- [ ] Tests for request cancellation
- [ ] GPU support
- [ ] Better template configuration options
- [ ] Expose more download configuration options
- [ ] Allow configuring model hashes
- [ ] Support preloading session contexts, like a long system message or few shot examples
- [ ] Allow configuration to limit RAM usage
- [ ] Support configuring a timeout on completion processing
- [ ] CLI to spin up a server given a config file or a model name
- [ ] API to add custom engines
- [ ] A mock engine for testing and implementing old-school chatbots
- [ ] Support Embeddings API

### Contributing

If you know how to fill in any of the above checkboxes or have additional ideas you'd like to make happen, feel free to open an issue or PR.

#### Possible Future Goals

- Create a separate HTTP API thats independent of the OpenAI spec.
- Add a clientside library (React hook?) for use of this independent API.
- Provide a CLI. (Launch a server via `lllms serve config.json|js`?)
- Provide a Docker image. And maybe a Prometheus endpoint.

#### Currently not the Goals

- Another facade to LLM hoster HTTP API's. The strengths here are local/private/offline use.
- Worry about authentication or rate limiting or misuse. Host this with caution, or build these things on top.
- Some kind of distributed or multi-node setup. Does not fit the scope well.
- Other tooling like vector stores, Chat GUIs, etc. Would wish for this to stay minimal and easy to understand.
